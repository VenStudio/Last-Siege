### Made for GameDev.tv Game Jam 2024

Last Siege is a 2D Side-View Tower-Defense Game where you must defend the Alabese Fortress from its demise.

---

## How to play
- Defend the fortress from incoming waves of enemies.
  - Start the waves with the "Start next wave" at the top right of the screen.
  - There are 8 waves in the game (sorry! There is no in-game UI for that)
- Buy traps and weapons from the shop to improve your defenses against enemy waves.
- Hover over the items in the shop to see an explanation of the item (hover over the button for about 2 seconds for it to show up, patience, brother)

## Controls
- Use the mouse to aim.
- Shoot with Left mouse click.
- Hold left mouse click to auto-fire.
- When placing a trap, press Escape to cancel placing it (no money loss)

## Playtime
around 5â€“10 minutes.

---

## Known bugs in the game
- buying a weapon you already own will consume money if you have enough to buy it (point is, don't press the Bow button in the shop, it will take 5 coins from your balance, sorry for that!)
- The "Buy +20 Castle Health" button does not have a displayed price, the price is 32.
